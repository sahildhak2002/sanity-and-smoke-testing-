# Smoke Testing
Definition:
Smoke Testing is a type of software testing that checks whether the basic and critical functionalities of the application are working properly. It is also known as a "Build Verification Test."

Purpose:
To determine whether the deployed build is stable enough to proceed with further testing.

When It's Done:

After receiving a new software build.

Before any detailed functional or regression testing.

Example:
Verifying that the login page loads, users can log in, and main menus are accessible.

# Sanity Testing
Definition:
Sanity Testing is a focused form of regression testing that verifies specific functionalities or bug fixes work as expected after changes in the code or new features are implemented.

Purpose:
To quickly evaluate whether a specific section of the application is functioning after a bug fix or new feature addition.

When It's Done:

After receiving a new build with minor changes.

After bug fixes or small enhancements.

Example:
If a bug in the profile update feature was fixed, Sanity Testing would verify only that feature to confirm the fix works and hasnâ€™t broken anything else.
